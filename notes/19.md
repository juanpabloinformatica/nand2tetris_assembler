Thinking process --- 19/03/2025

## Goal

- Test parser

## Steps

- I will try to look for instructions type C and A, and then see
  if the parser is able to split the instruction and gives back the
  expected results

- In my idea I did a file called Utilities.h in which I put all the enums
  the enums works in the following way:

    - INSTRUCTION_BITS --> this has 17 fields, eahc field represent a bit
      nevertheless the first field of value -1 is undefined, so normally
      it will represent 16 bits the number of bit of an instruction in the
      hack computer.

        - if i want to get the value of D1 for example I can call the
          field D1 that will be the bit number 10 in the [A|C]-instruction.

    - C_INSTRUCTION_DEST --> this has 9 fields, each field represent a bit but
      a similar situtation occurs and extra bit represent an undefined value.

        - the idea here is the following as the contract specifies how depending
          of the values D1,D2,D3 certain jump will be executed, so the idea is substract
          those values and get its value once concatenated (valueof(D1+D2+D3) (+ here is concatenating strings))
          so depending of the result, it will do an specific jump considering the contract

    - C_INSTRUCTION_JUMP --> this has 9 fields, each field represent a bit but
      a similar situtation occurs and extra bit represent an undefined value.

        - the idea here is the following as the contract specifies how depending
          of the values J1,J2,J3 certain jump will be executed, so the idea is substract
          those values and get its value once concatenated (valueof(J1+J2+J3) (+ here is concatenating strings))
          so depending of the result, it will do an specific jump considering the contract

    - C_INSTRUCTION_COMP --> this has 29 fields, each field represent a bit but
      a similar situtation occurs and extra bit represent an undefined value.

        - the idea here is the following as the contract specifies how depending
          of the values a,C1,C2,C3,C4,C5,C6 certain jump will be executed, so the idea is substract
          those values and get its value once concatenated (valueof(a,C1,C2,C3,C4,C5,C6) (+ here is concatenating strings))
          so depending of the result, it will do an specific jump considering the contract
